# Zombies
This is a simple simulation of humans and zombies using steering behaviors to randomly wander, avoid obstacles, and pursue/evade each other.

It was made using Processing, a Java-based language focused on simple graphical output.
For more information on Processing, visit https://processing.org/

This was a project for my Interactive Media Development course, I received a grade of 100% on this assignment.

The "Geyer_HVZ" folder contains all of my source code in pde files, which can be read using any text editor, although it is intended to be used with the official Processing IDE.

CONTROLS:

Left mouse click to spawn a human at the mouse position

Right mouse click to spawn a zombie at the mouse position

Number keys 1-4 display different debug information:

	1: display collision radii for all objects
	
	2: display movement information for forces and velocity direction/magnitude
	
	3: display chase information for what characters are pursuing or evading and show their chase radius
	
	4: display all of these at once

GUIDE FOR DEBUG INFORMATION SHOWN:

Red transparent box = Edge zone of map in which vehicles will turn around to stay in bounds

Red circle = collision radius

Yellow line = sum of forces being applied this frame	

Human-
	Blue line = velocity of human
	Blue circle = chase radius for zombies to evade
	Dark green line with orange circle at end = line to predicted positions of zombies evading

Zombie-
	Green line = velocity of zombie
	Green circle = chase radius for humans to pursue
	Red line with orange circle at end = line to predicted position of human currently chasing
